\abstract{  \OnePageChapter % one page only ??
This work applies the adaptive wavelet collocation methodology to various sets of equations that govern the ocean, with the goal of being able to more accurately predict global ocean circulation.  This work also improves the representation of continental topology and bottom bathymetry for use in ocean circulation models through an extension of the Brinkman penalization method. Due to the complicated geometry inherent in ocean boundaries, the stair-step representation used in the majority of current global ocean circulation models causes accuracy and stability problems. Brinkman penalization is a numerical technique used to enforce no slip boundary conditions through the addition of a term to the governing equations. When coupled with the Adaptive Wavelet Collocation Method, which solves the penalized equations on a temporally and spatially varying mesh, the flow near the boundary can be well defined for less computational cost. }
