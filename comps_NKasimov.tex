\abstract{  \OnePageChapter % one page only ??
  This work consist of two parts --- high and low fidelity simulations of supersonic flow around solid obstacles of arbitrary shapes, accordingly. This project is supported by ONR MURI on Soil Blast Modeling. Low fidelity simulations were performed by solving 3D Euler equations for supersonic flows in presence of obstacles using Roe solver as a shock capturing scheme and modification of Brinkman penalization method to handle obstacles through forcing terms. Particle-particle interactions were handled using 3D DEM solver and then coupled with Euler/Roe CFD solver. High fidelity simulations, on the other hand, were performed using Adaptive Wavelet Collocation Method for grid adaptation and adaptive differentiation, Artificial Viscosity Method as a shock capturing scheme and Characteristic Based Volume Penalization Method to handle solid obstacles through forcing terms.
